# ADHD Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Project Overview
This project involves developing machine learning models to predict Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using a given dataset. The dataset consists of two classes: ADHD and Control. The ADHD class represents individuals affected by ADHD, while the Control class represents normal individuals. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate various machine learning models to accurately classify individuals into these two categories.

### Project Name
ADHD Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Description
ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder affecting both children and adults. Early and accurate prediction of ADHD is crucial for effective treatment and management. This project aims to develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms to classify individuals as either ADHD or Control based on relevant features from the dataset.

### Project Phases
1. **Data Collection**: Gather the ADHD dataset containing features relevant to the disorder.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform raw data into meaningful features suitable for model training.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluate various machine learning algorithms for classification.
5. **Model Building**: Develop and train models using selected algorithms.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of two classes:
- **ADHD (1)**: Individuals affected by Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
- **Control (0)**: Normal individuals.

### Model Performance
The dataset was tested against various machine learning models, and the best results are summarized below:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Accuracy: 89.7%

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Accuracy: 58%

3. **Naive Bayes**
   - Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Accuracy 51%
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes: Accuracy 54%
