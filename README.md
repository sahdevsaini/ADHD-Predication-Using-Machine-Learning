# ADHD-Predication-Using-Machine-Learning
DHD dataset was considred for this assignment. This dataset consists of two classes ADHD and Control where ADHD means the person is affected with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and control means the person is normal. The labels were also added to these vectors were:- 1 -> ADHD class 0 -> Control class Finally the dataset was tested against various machine learning models.For each model the best results are summarised below :-

2.) Logistic Regression with accuracy 58%

3.) Naive Bayes.

a. Benolli Naive Bayes with accuracy 51%. 
b. Gaussian Naive Bayes with accuracy 54%.
